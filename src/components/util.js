    title: "Another Country by James Baldwin",
    body:
      "At WITNESS.org, we collaborate closely with communities who are using video to tell the story of systemic racism. Baldwin’s novel is set in the fifties, but it compellingly describes what the videos we see today are showing us. — Yvette Alberdingk Thijm (TED Talk: The power of citizen video to create undeniable truths)",

  {
    title: "A Lucky Man by Jamel Brinkley",
    body:
      "Rarely is a debut collection lauded as an instant classic and justifiably so. With heart and humanity, Man explores the emotional lives of black men and boys. Brinkley’s prose is poetic and lush, and each story is a rich world unto itself. Just as the Caribbean celebration J’ouvert heralds the breaking of a new dawn, this book signals the arrival of a unique and necessary voice in fiction. — Felice Belle (TED Talk with Jennifer Murphy: How we became sisters)",

  {
    title: "A Lucky Man by Jamel Brinkley",
    body:
      "Stunning. Set in Brooklyn and the Bronx, these short stories feature black male protagonists trying to move through the world while being haunted by the past. It’s a gorgeous, heart-wrenching, shining collection. — Jennifer Murphy (TED Talk with Felice Belle: How we became sisters)",
  },

  {
    title: "Sophie’s Misfortunes by La Comtesse de Ségur",
    body:
      "I re-read this children’s book once every two or three years because it is such a great piece of French literature! It is both very accessible and still very deep, and this 19th-century classic has a special place in the history of children’s books. — Rebecca Kleinberger (TED Talk: Why you don’t like the sound of your own voice)",
  },

  {
    title: "A Visit From the Goon Squad by Jennifer Egan",
    body:
      "I was in the record business for many years, and I’ve tried writing about it but found it impossible to describe. Egan does it perfectly here, and this book is about so much, much more — deliciously, intriguingly, beguilingly so. — Daniel Levitin (TED Talk: How to stay calm when you know you’ll be stressed)",
  },

  {
    title: "Vengeance by Zachary Lazar",
    body:
      "This contemplative, precise, mesmerizing novel is a smash-up of fiction and nonfiction. The author fuses the genres to ruminate on our constructs of crime and punishment, yielding lines like this: “…most people in prison are there not for the public’s safety but out of vengeance, or hatred, or because if they were let out we would have to help them.” Lazar is a truthteller. — Eve Abrams (TED Talk: The human stories behind mass incarceration)",
  },

  {
    title: "Love in the Time of Cholera by Gabriel García Márquez",
    body:
      "The incredibly fantastic magical realism that Márquez weaves throughout this book is so eerily and uncannily African in some ways. It made me rethink and see anew some aspects of African life. — Iké Udé (TED Talk: The radical beauty of Africa, in portraits)",
  },

  {
    title: "Big Little Lies by Liane Moriarty",
    body:
      "I’m sure I’m not the only one to put this book on the top of a summer reading list, but I’d be remiss not to name it. It was a pure guilty pleasure and my definition of a great summer read. The characters, the storyline and mystery — even if you have seen the equally wonderful HBO adaptation — make this book nearly impossible to put down. It’s escapism at its best. — Wendy Troxel (TED Talk: Why school should start later for teens)",
  },

  {
    title: "What Alice Forgot by Liane Moriarty",
    body:
      "I’ve always loved Moriarty’s novels — you may have seen HBO’s Big Little Lies — and this one is no exception. I don’t always hold myself to deadlines when reading — I frequently join book clubs and end up reading the cliff notes at the last minute — but I was taken from the opening lines and couldn’t stop thinking about the page-turning storyline. — Mindy Scheier (TED Talk: How adaptive clothing empowers people with disabilities)",
  },

  {
    title: "Charcoal Joe by Walter Mosley",
    body:
      "This mystery, which is part of the Easy Rawlins series, focuses on art, friendship and storytelling. I love the mysteries explored here and what the book says about life and relationships. — Deborah Willis (TED Talk with Hank Willis Thomas: A mother and son united by love and art)",
  },

  {
    title: "The Overstory by Richard Powers",
    body:
      "I never wanted this book to end. Trees, trees and more trees form the centerpiece of this breathlessly beautiful, evocative novel that swept me from character to character and limb to limb. Gorgeous. — Eve Abrams (TED Talk: The human stories behind mass incarceration)",
  },

  {
    title: "Lincoln in the Bardo by George Saunders",
    body:
      "This is a hilarious and poignant telling of the story of the death of Abraham Lincoln’s son, narrated by the ghosts who haunt the graveyard where he was entombed. It was a fascinating read, and it really stayed with me — in a good way. — Karen Lloyd (TED Talk: This deep-sea mystery is changing our understanding of life)",
  },

  {
    title: "Late Fame by Arthur Schnitzler",
    body:
      "This book, which was rescued from obscurity through a wonderful new translation, is a funny, tragic novella on the corrupting influence of sudden and unexpected fame. — Daniel Susskind (TED Talk: 3 myths about the future of work and why they’re not true)",
  },

  {
    title: "The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas",
    body:
      "The voice of the narrator is clear as a bell and persuasive to the hilt. The events in this young-adult novel could have been stolen right from the headlines, but it’s told from a perspective that I’m unaccustomed to find in a novel: a young African-American high schooler. This book is just as good as all the reviewers have said — believe the hype. — Eve Abrams (TED Talk: The human stories behind mass incarceration)",
  },

  {
    title:
      "When your brain longs for a break from texts and DMs and craves poetry instead",
    body:
      "Catalog of Unabashed Gratitude by Ross Gay This is easily one of the best books of poetry in the last decade — and certainly one of the most beautiful collections ever. Whatever the disease of the heart or soul, this is the remedy. Here’s one line: “I want so badly to rub the sponge of gratitude over every last thing, including you, which, yes, awkward…” — Drew Philp (TED Talk: My $500 house in Detroit and the neighbors who helped me rebuilt it)",
  },

  {
    title: "Catalog of Unabashed Gratitude by Ross Gay",
    body:
      "This big-hearted little book of poems embraces joy even as it’s willing to weigh joy’s opposite — loss and grief. It’s a stunning book, filled with long poems that make you delight in being alive. I especially recommend steeping yourself in Gay’s revelry in anticipation for his upcoming essay collection, which will be published in winter 2019. I’m using this poetry collection to tide me over until then. — Heather Lanier (TED Talk: “Good” and “bad” are incomplete stories we tell",
  },

  {
    title: "The Prophet by Khalil Gibran",
    body:
      "The Prophet is a book of 26 prose poetry fables written in English by a Lebanese-American poet and writer. Originally published in 1923, it is Gibran’s best known work. It has been translated into most of the world’s languages, and I have read it cover to cover over one hundred times. It’s a must-read. — Azim Khamisa (TED Talk with Ples Felix: What comes after tragedy? Forgiveness)",
  },

  {
    title: "salt. by Nayyirah Waheed",
    body:
      "This is, hands down, one of my favorite books of poetry and one that I return to regularly for inspiration, solace and wisdom. Waheed’s unique style breaks many of the traditional rules of poetry, but she leverages her creative approach for maximum effect. Whether consisting of a single sentence or multiple pages, her poems tackle topics from love to race to feminism in ways that feel like they always touch me at my core. ",
